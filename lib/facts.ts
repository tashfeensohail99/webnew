/**
 * Every legal/programme fact this site states in public, with its source and the
 * date it was checked.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: immigration rules change constantly, and a stale fact on
 * a page where someone commits their savings is a liability, not a typo. Facts
 * scattered through JSX rot silently and cannot be audited. Here, one file can be
 * re-checked in an hour and every page updates.
 *
 * THE RULE: if it isn't in this file with a source, it does not get stated as
 * fact on a page. Anything a lawyer hasn't signed off carries `needsLawyer: true`
 * and must not ship.
 *
 * Provenance levels:
 *   'primary'   — read from the government/court/official source itself.
 *   'secondary' — reputable firm or news reporting; NOT yet confirmed against the
 *                 primary text. Several official sites (canada.ca,
 *                 travel.state.gov) block automated fetching, so a human must
 *                 open them. Treat as a lead, never as publishable truth.
